How to Use the Script
   0. Donwload the script and make it executable with chmod +x
   
   1. Navigate to your home directory or where the script is located.
   2. Run the script with the name of the package you want to install.

  For example, to install the package btop:

   1 ./aur-install.sh btop

  The script will then download, build, and install the package. Since package installation requires root privileges,
  you will be prompted to enter your sudo password during the final step.
